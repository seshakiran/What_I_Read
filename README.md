# What_I_Read
WhatIRead helps with creating your personal database of the websites that you read using your local browser on PC. 

# Why this
I want to keep track of all the articles I read daily. At any point of time, I wanted to build my own DB of articles that I read by importing them in to Obsidian (My second brain). 
There are no specific tools that I was able to find. Created this for the same reason. 

# How this works
Use this code to create a Chrome extension. You can load this directory by enabling the "developer mode" in the chrome extensions ("Chrome://extensions") and using the "Load Unpacked" option.

This would create an extension on your extension bar. Pin it. 

This will make use of "IndexedDB" available on majority of the browsers. This is not available across browsers at this time.

# How to use this
Whenver you find an interesting article of your liking, simply click the extension. A pop up opens by displaying the title, date and the info. You will have two options. 
1. Mark for export
2. View and Export

You can use the option 1 stated above to mark this as an article of interest for you.

Use option 2 if you want to see the complete list of articles you saved from the beginning.

This opens up another window where it will list all the websites you marked for export. You can hit "Export" button to download the list of the same neatly in markdown format. You can further copy these into your second brain tool like Obsidian.
